## [2025-01-24] - US-001
- Reorganized routes module into subdirectories (src/routes/)
- Split routes.rs (510 lines) into focused files:
  - mod.rs (99 lines) - Module exports, AppState, helper functions
  - handlers.rs (258 lines) - HTTP request handlers
  - health.rs (71 lines) - Health check endpoint
  - router.rs (86 lines) - Router creation and middleware configuration
  - types.rs (24 lines) - Route-specific types
- All imports and module declarations resolve correctly
- cargo check, cargo test, and cargo clippy all pass

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Rust treats `mod routes;` as a module directory if `routes/` exists with `mod.rs`, or as a file `routes.rs` if that exists instead
- When splitting modules, move helper functions that are used by multiple sub-modules to the parent `mod.rs` to avoid circular dependencies
- Use `pub(crate)` for items only needed within the crate and `pub` for external visibility
- The module system requires explicit re-exports (`pub use`) for items that need to be accessible from outside the module
- Unused imports can be cleaned up incrementally - compile first, then fix warnings
